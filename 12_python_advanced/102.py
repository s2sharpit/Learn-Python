# Optimizing
# In programming, it is considered to be a bad practice to optimize before you actually create the code.
# This is because you might spend a lot of time optimizing something that doesn't need to be optimized.
# The best approach is to create the code and then optimize it.
# Make sure you get what you need up and running before you start optimizing.
